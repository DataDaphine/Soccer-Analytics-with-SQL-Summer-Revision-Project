# 📚 SQL Summer Review – Football Match Analysis

This project is a self-directed SQL revision completed during Summer 2025, revisiting coursework from a university-level database class. The dataset consists of European football (soccer) matches, and the aim was to deepen my understanding of SQL through exploratory and analytical queries.

The goal was to strengthen my understanding of:
- SQL query logic and execution order
- Data relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one)
- Aggregations and filtering
- Date-based analysis
- Player and match performance metrics

## 🧠 Topics Covered
