# 📚 SQL Summer Review – Football Match Analysis

This project contains a self-directed SQL revision based on coursework from a university database class. Over Summer 2025, I revisited assignments and explored deeper data analysis using SQL queries on a football match dataset.

The goal was to strengthen my understanding of:
- SQL query logic and execution order
- Data relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one)
- Aggregations and filtering
- Date-based analysis
- Player and match performance metrics

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Identifying data relationships in a relational schema
- Calculating home court advantage by country
- Analyzing goal trends across seasons and months
- Investigating the "Moneyball" effect
- Determining peak player performance age
- Evaluating goalkeepers by season
- Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`, `CASE`, and date functions

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite syntax)
- Football Match Dataset (from coursework or public football datasets)
- Git + GitHub for version control and documentation
